The goal of the {cspsreports} package is to create PDF reports from your Civil Service People Survey (CSPS) microdata.

Find the [Civil Service People Survey on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-people-surveys).

The package is a work in progress with no guarantees. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of {cspsreports} from GitHub.

To install:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("co-analysis/cspsreports")
```

This assumes you've added a GitHub personal access token (PAT) to your .Renviron. Run `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to open the browser and generate an auth token, then `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to open the .Renviron file. Add the token on a new line in the form `GITHUB_PAT=<your token>`, save and restart R. Learn more from the [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html) book.
